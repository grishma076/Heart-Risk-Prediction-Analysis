Project Overview:

Feature Entity:
- Age
- Gender
- Heart rate (Number of heartbeats per sec)
- Systolic blood pressure (Maximum blood pressure during a heartbeat(mmHg))
- Diastolic blood pressure (Minimum blood pressure in between a heartbeat(mmHg)) 
- Blood Sugar (Blood Glucose level(mg/dL))
- CK-MB (Creatine Kinase-MB (ng/mL). A cardiac enzyme used to detect heart damage.)
- Troponin (Troponin level (ng/mL). A protein highly specific to heart damage.)
